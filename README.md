<p align='left'> Hi, I'm John, a professional data analyst with experience on more than 16 technical projects. My skills include data analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, and ML. Now, I am eagar to leverage my big data skills in the business and technology sphere to drive growth and efficiency.

Currently I am working with customer data to identify the factors that lead to churn and the liklihood that a customer will churn from a internet company. My previous experience as a Sales and Marketing leader have helped my develop my communication, teamwork, analytical, time management, and problem-solving skills. 

In 2024, I enrolled in TripleTen's 10-month Data Science program. The curriculum covered Python (Pandas, NumPy), data visualization (Matplotlib, plotly, Tableau), machine learning (skikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow), SQL and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

Some facts about me:
- I enjoy participating in professional events, especially meetups involving data science.
- I love the outdoors, especially hiking and mountain biking.
- At the moment, I am preparing to run my first 10k race.
- My goals for 2025: landing my dream job in data and getting a dog.
